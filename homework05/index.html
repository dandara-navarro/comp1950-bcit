                <p class="synopsis">Man's Search for Meaning is a 1946 book by Viktor Frankl chronicling his experiences as a 
                prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, and describing his psychotherapeutic 
                method, which involved identifying a purpose in life to feel positive about, and then immersively
                imagining that outcome.</p>

                    Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions 
                    of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945 
                    Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and 
                    pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated 
                    later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to 
                    cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory-known 
                    as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos ("meaning")-holds that our primary drive in life is 
                    not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.
